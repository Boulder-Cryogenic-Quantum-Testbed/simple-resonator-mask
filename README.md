# simple-resonator-mask
A simple, standard resonator mask for superconducting microwave resonators towards 1:1 comparisons of dielectric losses from the metal-substrate interface.

This white paper presents a single-layer mask for the fabrication of superconducting microwave resonators towards 1:1 comparisons of dielectric losses from the metal-substrate interface. Finite-element electromagnetic simulations are used to determine participation ratios of the four major regions of the on-chip devices, as well as to confirm lack of crosstalk between neighboring devices and demonstrate coupling tunability over three orders of magnitude. This mask is intended as an open-source community resource for facilitating precise and accurate comparisons of materials in the single-photon, millikelvin regime.

This mask is named COH-SQMS. "COH" refers to its application as a coherence indicator, and "SQMS" refers to the Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems Center, which funded this effort.
